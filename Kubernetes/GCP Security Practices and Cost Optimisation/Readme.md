Hi Team,
 
We are arranging this session to walk you through the best practices for security and cost optimization to follow while creating and managing the resources on GCP.
 
We have identified some key areas where we can work on to optimize the cost and enhance the security as well. 
 
•	GKE Private cluster for Commerce project products
•	Compute Engine VMs without external IP
•	VPC and f/w rules
•	Scaling down of the GCP resources when not in use
•	Make use of Preemptible VM instances 
 
Request you to join this session to get the details on how we can work on the above key areas. 
 
Please forward this as required.
